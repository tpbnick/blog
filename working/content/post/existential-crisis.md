Recently, I stumbled upon an album on YouTube titled, "[Everywhere at The End of Time](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Everywhere_at_the_End_of_Time)".  The album was created by the Caretaker and was released in "stages" from 2016 to 2019.  The album's main goal was to depict the stages of dementia.  As the album passes, which is over 6.5 hours long, the songs become more distorted and less recognizable.  This genuinely creates a sense of foreboding and restlessness, but it is hard to stop listening.

The artwork, created by the Caretaker's long-time friend [Ivan Seal](http://ivanseal.com/), becomes more abstract and eerie with each passing stage, perfectly echoing the music's somber and haunting melodies.

I began listening to the album without any warning of how it was going to affect me.  

After listening to the album over multiple sittings, I began to think about my late great-grandparents and grandfather.  I remembered how they, especially my great-grandparents, were unable to truly hold a conversation and seemed to be in a trance-like state near the end of their lives.  We would visit them in their assisted-living facilities and I always had the question at the back of my mind, "Do they really know who I am?"  The song titles throughout "Everywhere at The End of Time" also mirror that same idea.  From "It's just a burning memory", "Slightly bewildered", "The loves of my entire life", "Last moments of pure recall", "Post awareness confusions", to the final "Place in the world fades away", these names invoked unsparing visions into my possible future.

Music has always given me a visceral feeling and often leads to goosebumps.  Certain songs can also remind me of different times and people.  A very specific memory I have from my childhood is sitting outside my grandfather's garage and the ending of the Beach Boy's "[Good Vibrations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eab_beh07HU)".  The song fades to a solo harmonica (around the 2:30 mark) and this almost always causes me to either tear-up or think of some other memories I have with him.  

My great-grandparents and grandfather did not have dementia later in their lives, but the album truly made me think about the mortality of my memories.  [Around 11% of people older than 65 years old have Alzheimer's](https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/facts-figures#prevalence) or another form of dementia in the United States.  This statistic made me reconsider what I have been doing to "preserve" my memories.  Throughout most of human history, we have not had any medium to record our thoughts and memories, other than writing them down.  Often, these writings get lost in time or discarded.  I have made the decision to begin documenting some of my thoughts, feelings, and memories on this blog to create a record that I may look at in the future and hopefully better remember.  

[Keeping a journal or a diary is a suggested memory aid](https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/get-support/staying-independent/traditional-memory-aids) and I intend on creating some sort of collection of writing to better inform my future self, or my future children/grand-children, about *who* I was earlier in my life.  Although I am starting at the age of 26, I feel that I can still create a weekly or monthly update, on little things in my life or thoughts on current world events, that will have some kind of insight into *who* I *was*.  I also plan on including the music I am currently listening to and recent articles or life events that affected me.  

After listening to "Everywhere at The End of Time", I decided to look into the Caretaker's other work.  Since 1999, he has created [countless albums](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/The_Caretaker_(musician)#/Discography) that often have the same similar "haunted ballroom" sound to them.  I began listening to the album "An Empty Bliss Beyond This World" and the song "Libet's Delay" caused a very emotional reaction from me.  I instantly had this memory of my grandfather and I playing chess or checkers while watching classic movies when I was around 9 or 10 years old.  He often enjoyed having older movies (~1940s-1960s) playing on the TV and the music must have been similar to some dorment memory I had made sitting there with him almost two decades ago.

The Caretaker's music has left me in a state of both distress and peace.  The timeless tunes mixed with the reverb and crackle that time will almost certainly apply to my memories led to somewhat of an existential crossroads.  Do I sit in melancholy waiting for the inevitable corrosion of my current memories or should I do all that I can to make sure they are written down for future retrospection?  I often choose the more "hopeful" option when questions like this are presented to me throughout life, as I am attempting to do now.  I look forward to reading these posts and reminiscing about the present, in the future.
